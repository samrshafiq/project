How best to create high quality software is a separate and controversial problem covering software design principles, so-called "best practices" for writing code, as well as broader management issues such as optimal team size, process, how best to deliver software on time and as quickly as possible, work-place "culture", hiring practices, and so forth.

Many projects ran over budget and schedule. Some projects caused property damage. A few projects caused loss of life.[13] The software crisis was originally defined in terms of productivity, but evolved to emphasize quality. Some used the term software crisis to refer to their inability to hire enough qualified programmers.[citation needed]

Fred Brooks claims in The Mythical Man-Month that he made a multimillion-dollar mistake of not developing a coherent architecture before starting development.[12]
                                Property Damage: Software defects can cause property damage. Poor software security allows hackers to steal identities, costing time, money, and reputations.[citation needed]
                                Life and Death: Software defects can kill. Some embedded systems used in radiotherapy machines failed so catastrophically that they administered lethal doses of radiation to patients. The most famous of these failures is the Therac-25 incident.[14]

Nevertheless, software – especially real-time embedded software – remains risky and is pervasive, and it is crucial not to give in to complacency. Over the last 10–15 years Michael A. Jackson has written extensively about the nature of software engineering, has identified the main source of its difficulties as lack of specialization, and has suggested that his problem frames provide the basis for a "normal practice" of software engineering, a prerequisite if software engineering is to become an engineering science.</td>

<dt>1985 to 1989: "No Silver Bullet"</dt>
<dd>For decades, solving the software crisis was paramount to researchers and companies producing software tools. The cost of owning and maintaining software in the 1980s was twice as expensive as developing the software.[citation needed]

        During the 1990s, the cost of ownership and maintenance increased by 30% over the 1980s.
        In 1995, statistics showed that half of surveyed development projects were operational, but were not considered successful.
        The average software project overshoots its schedule by half.
        Three-quarters of all large software products delivered to the customer are failures that are either not used at all, or do not meet the customer's requirements.</dd>
